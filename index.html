      <p class="h3">Examining the (gender) diversity of the German parliament over its history</h3>

    <p>
      For the last 16 years, Germany has been widely known for its female chancellor, Angela Merkel. With a leading
      woman, you might imply a strong female force within the German parliament. But is that truly so?
    </p>
    <p>
      The autumn of 2018 marked Germany's 100-year jubilee of women's right to vote in the country. Journalistic
      coverage of the celebratory reception showed a stage full of merely unknown female politicians. A rare, colourful
      photo to be taken, in a society that is used to seeing predominately white old men in grey suits when picturing
      current political representatives. In her speech on the reception day, it was Merkel herself who reminded German
      citizens:
    </p>
    <p class="textHighlight">
      "One swallow doesn't make a summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mere existence should not be considered an alibi for the
      country to regard itself with equal chances for all genders to inhabit (political) positions of power. Despite
      ongoing efforts, Germany must yet walk a long way to achieve true gender equality and representation in the
      federal parliament. So, let's wind back the clock first and have a closer look at the representation of gender in
      the history of the German parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before doing so, a few facts need to be stated about Germany's political history and election system at a glance.
      After the Second World War, the four victorious powers, France, England, the Soviet Union, and the USA, took over
      the governance of the country and its occupation zones. While at first there was agreement among the allies on the
      prospective strategies to rebuild Germany, the emergence of different interests led to a separation of the country
      into East (German Democratic Republic, GDR) and West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany, BRD). Due to the Cold
      War in the 1960s between the United States and the Soviet Union, the fronts hardened and the Soviet Union built a
      wall that would divide Germany for almost 30 years. Only in 1989, on the account of large demonstrations in the
      East, Germany reunited into a single state and a unified parliament in Berlin. Throughout this time, Germany was
      headed by male chancellors up until 2005, when Angela Merkel as the first woman took over the seat. Today, members
      of the parliament can win a seat in the parliament in two different ways, either voted for directly as a single
      member of the parliament, or in a list election, which means based on a proposed list by parties.

      Preface: This article often projects gender in a binary fashion, divided into men and women. This is due to the
      data collection that lacks any information on other genders. I want to acknowledge that gender is a spectrum and
      demand a more nuanced way of gathering demographical data of representatives going forward.

      In what has historically been seen as a male business, women have become more and more involved in federal
      governance for the last 70 years. Despite growth in female representation, one cannot talk about the parity of the
      two genders today, not to mention that no data on other genders is even collected. As it becomes clear through the
      graph, in the year of celebrations, 2018, the 19th federal parliament reached a national low in the representation
      of women since 1998. While it was only 31% women then, in the newly elected parliament of 2021, the seats taken up
      by women slightly increased to 35%. The German newspaper Spiegel called it "not a record, but a glimmer of hope".
      As of the 1st of March 2022, Germany is ranking on 42nd place out of 188 in international parliament comparisons
      in gender equality of the IPU, with countries like Rwanda, Cuba, New Zealand and Finland on top of the list.
    </p>
    <p>The slight increase in female representation in the new parliament might be due to a larger number of women
      inhabiting higher rankings in the parties’ election lists. Looking at the previous graph, data suggests that men
      are more likely to be voted directly into parliament, while the majority of women get their seats through
      listings. The graph provides a basis for the ongoing discussion on a quota for political parties to define a
      percentage within the list rankings. Political scientist Thomas Saalfeld states, </p>
    <p class="textHighlight">
      "In the current [election] system, it is only parties' [election lists] that can make a change to diversity".
    </p>
    <p>Those parties in Germany that claim to be progressive are the ones that set a quota for their listings as their
      flagship. The next graph will reveal, whether the specification of an election list percentage affected the
      chances of women joining the parliaments over the last eight election periods.</p>

    <p>
      After seeing this graph, you might question whether a female quota is not only raising chances for women to share
      in political power but is also beneficial for the party itself. You could assume, that women elect women and
      therefore female politicians inhabit the potential to attract a larger electorate. Well, this is not fully the
      case. Looking at election statistics, women do not necessarily vote for women because of their shared gender. But
      what holds true is that women are statistically more interested in topics that concern matters they relate to,
      which are more likely to be advocated by a female politician.
    </p>
    <p>No matter if a party is interested in a quota or not, article 38 in the German Basic Law quite frankly says: </p>
    <p class="textHighlight">
      "The members of the German Bundestag ... are representatives of the whole people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the whole people. We are, nonetheless, living in a so-called 'representative democracy'. Shouldn't this be
      reason enough that a parliament represents the German society in all its colour? Gender diversity is only one
      aspect of diversity and many other factors need to be taken into account when assessing the German 'Bundestag' in
      its representative function. So, who is missing from the parliament?

          reflect society, there would have to be 140 more women as members of the parliament.
          Additionally, data is needed on other genders than the ones on a binary scale.

        <div class="description-heading">Age</div>
        <div class="description-text">
          There is a gap in both age directions. On the one hand, 18% of under 20-year-olds are missing, as well as 21%
          of seniors over the age of 58 to represent the full width of demographics. If the parliament were to reflect
          society, there would have to be 127 more under 21-year-olds and 146 more over-58-year-olds as members of the
          parliament.

        <div class="description-heading">Ethnicity</div>
        <div class="description-text">
          As the German society is rich in ethnicities, the parliament is missing 11% of people that were born abroad.
          This would mean, 78 more parliament members are needed to fill the void of diverse perspectives, on
          immigration topics especially.

        <div class="description-heading">Religion</div>
        <div class="description-text">
          Although Christianity is the most common religion in Germany, the religion is slightly overrepresented, as 14
          more members of the parliament belong to the religious beliefs, whereas 6% of Muslims are not represented in
          the parliament, which equals 43 more Muslims needed to have a true representation of the distribution of all
          religious beliefs in Germany.

        <div class="description-heading">Marital Status</div>
        <div class="description-text">
          Looking at the marital status of German society, there is currently a gap of 22% among single people. 158 more
          singles would be needed to mirror society's family constitutions. This leads to 147 more married parliament
          members than is actually the case in society.

        <div class="description-text">
          A majority of people that become members of the parliament have worked in public services beforehand,
          actually, 23% more than is the case reflecting the number of German citizens that work for public
          institutions. Besides, there are proportionally much more PhDs members of parliament, 133 than the
          proportional amount of Germans with a PhD. On the other side, 194 people are missing that have graduated from
          secondary school as their main education.

        <div class="description-text">
          Surprisingly, the LGBTQ community has almost an equal representation, only 2% missing from the parliament. 14
          homo- or bisexual people would need to inhabit a seat during a political discussion to act in a place of
          society's diverse views.

          Despite the parliament appointing a Federal Government Commissioner for Matters relating to Persons with
          Disabilities, the members themselves lack 6% of representation of people with disabilities. 4 more disabled
          people are missing to have the parliament exemplifying society's constitution.

      The simple answer is that a lot of people are missing. Many social groups are severely underrepresented in their
      own parliament. Of course, what plays into this is that some groups might not be very much interested in running
      for a seat in parliament, or even participating in elections. But wouldn’t you agree that there is more effort
      needed to capture more colourful pictures of parliament members instead of elderly men in grey suits?
